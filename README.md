# Armor

**Armor** is a lightweight toolkit designed to simplify common setup and maintenance tasks, helping developers stay productive by automating repetitive workflows. _(Currently in its early stages of development.)_

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GIT_PATH`: (Optional) Set this to the path of your Git installation if it's not in the default location, which is typically `C:\Program Files\Git` on Windows. This is necessary if Git is installed in a non-default directory. For example:
  ```sh
  export GIT_PATH="C:\\Your\\Custom\\Git\\Path"
  ```

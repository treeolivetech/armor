# Manage Bash Aliases

`@wakskevin/manage-bash-aliases` is a tool to quickly set up bash aliases on any Linux machine/server, avoiding the need to manually configure them each time.

## Features

- **Create or Overwrite .bash_aliases:** Checks if the .bash_aliases file exists and provides an option to overwrite it.

- **Alias Management:** Adds a predefined set of aliases for updating, editing, and refreshing the .bash_aliases file, along with aliases for repositories, Django, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and more.

## Installation

- Ensure Nodejs is installed in your system.

- Use `npx` to run the package directly without installing:

```bash
npx github:wakskevin/manage-bash-aliases
```
